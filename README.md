# ʻākohekohe
26-key, column-staggered, unibody-split keyboard made with [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) and [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). Named after the [ʻākohekohe bird](https://www.mauiforestbirds.org/akohekohe/), (“AH-kohay-kohay”), consider donating to the Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project. 

Basically a ZilpZalp with thumbs cut off, and the most comfortable layout I have found.

## Firmware
ZMK is what I use and have setup a shield for. Though the matrix is the same as a Hummingbird so you can use hummingbird firmware just fine.

## Inspiration & Thanks
- jcmkk3's [rufous](https://github.com/jcmkk3/trochilidae#rufous) hummingbird variation. Of which I used the Ergogen config, routing, and footprints.
